======================

The CVI DE voucher# 111358 /Inv# dummy invoice of MOTEL ONE MUENCHEN-MESSE is a manual invoice which is missing the requester and hence the invoice approval is in error and appropriately appearing in the report.

In order to remove this error from the report the following needs to be done:-


1. From Actions, stop the approval of the invoice.
2. Un apply the prepayment from the invoice and save.
3. Populate appropriate requester in the invoice header, whose supervisor would need to approve the invoice.
4. Re-apply the same prepayment to the invoice.(NB:-new accounting of prepayment unapply and apply would take place in the current month, which should be fine )
5. Validate the invoice
6. Re-initiate the approval of the invoice.

Once the invoice is approved, all should be sorted with the invoice.

We did a comparative analysis of the program runtime for the last 1 year and the overall average runtime of the concurrent is around .60 seconds. After the crowd strike (since 19th July), we can see 3 occurrences overall where the concurrent took longer time for Nordics (approx. 60mins on average) out of 2000 runs which can happen sometimes due to high load on the system.

We also checked with the DBA's during yesterday's occurrence and did not find anything unusual which could have caused performance issue.We will keep on monitoring this job and if the concurrent runs longer consistently – we will initiate necessary performance related checks.

Regards,
Nilak"

All the given orders worked as per the business expectation because no order consolidation hold was applied for any of the below orders . 

The order will be placed on order consolidation hold only if the customer place diagnostic items without any revenue items.

1. If customer don't want to consolidate multiple customer Pos on 1 Sales Order. Then customer has to place order with the below scenario's

 Place order with diagnostic and revenue together
 Place order with only revenue items

2. If customer want to consolidate multiple customer Pos on 1 Sales Order. Then customer has to place order with the below scenario's

  Customer should place order only with trail lens items, because if the customer place order only with trail (diagnostic) item then order consolidation hold will be applied for this order and if customer place any new order either trail or revenue or diagnostic+revenue , the new order will be consolidated with the existing order and existing customer po number. 

Working Scenario's.

115214880 // po 09617 // 25-MAR-2024 06:01:33// diagnostic and revenue
115219178 // 09673 S // 25-MAR-2024 08:24:22 // revenue
115219609// po 09811 // 25-MAR-2024 08:45:51 // revenue

Thanks for sharing the details.

To clear the DCOGS balance in the report, we need to invoice the Sales Order lines and create invoices. Please let us know if you want us to clear the DCOGS balance or no further action from our side.

Below is the summary of what we discussed and agreed upon:

i) This issue is of incorrect aging amount in ""Aging - 7 Buckets  - By Account Report"" in the in transaction currency when the report is run post application of multiple receipts which makes the balance to zero, but with As of Date parameter in past ;which is a valid business requirement.
ii) After lot of deliberation for long time with Oracle it has been established that this can only be resolved by a patch 35169420:R12.AR.C application.
iii) Since this patch addresses a lot of bugs it is not prudent to go ahead with this patch as we are having important and big releases of R4 and JUMP in the coming few months.
iv) Eszter also suggested , that they would be following a workaround to schedule and keep the report  EOM or Day1 for the previous month.

v) In view of the above it has been decided that this patch will be on hold and parked in intake INT0018371 and be taken up for testing and application later on; while the subjected ticket can be closed as a known solution and a feasible workaround is already in place.

Appreciate your patience and understanding.

Thanks and Regards,
Samiddha
